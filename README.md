# gogrep

> **v0.0.1** | **Experimental** — APIs and flags may change without notice.

A high-performance grep alternative written in pure Go, designed exclusively for Linux AMD64. Uses raw Linux syscalls, AVX2 SIMD acceleration, and memory-mapped I/O to maximize search throughput.

Built in ~4 hours of vibe coding with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).

## Features

- **AVX2 SIMD search** — fixed-string patterns use a SIMD-friendly Horspool algorithm that compares 32 byte positions per iteration
- **Search-then-split** — searches the entire file buffer first, then extracts line boundaries only around matches (avoids per-line overhead)
- **Memory-mapped I/O** — large files are mmap'd with `MAP_POPULATE` + `MADV_SEQUENTIAL` for zero-copy search
- **Raw syscalls** — `getdents64`, `openat`, `fstatat`, `pread`, `writev`, `inotify`, `epoll` — no portable Go abstractions
- **Parallel recursive search** — worker pool distributes files across `NumCPU * 2` goroutines with deterministic output ordering
- **Multiple pattern engines** — Go regex (RE2), PCRE2 (pure Go port), Boyer-Moore with SIMD, Aho-Corasick multi-pattern
- **Watch mode** — inotify + epoll file watching with log rotation handling
- **JSON output** — JSON Lines format for programmatic consumption
- **Pure Go, no cgo** — no C bindings or assembly files

## Requirements

- **Go 1.26+** with `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`
- **Linux AMD64** (x86-64 with AVX2 — Intel Haswell+ or AMD Excavator+)
- `golang.org/x/sys` for Linux syscall bindings

## Building

```sh
# Build
GOEXPERIMENT=simd go build -o bin/gogrep ./cmd/gogrep

# Or use make
make build
```

## Installation

```sh
GOEXPERIMENT=simd go install github.com/dl/gogrep/cmd/gogrep@latest
```

Or with make:

```sh
make install
```

## Testing

```sh
# Run all tests (PCRE tests run separately due to -race incompatibility)
make test

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Profile against ripgrep
make profile

# Lint
make lint
```

## Usage

```
gogrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
gogrep [OPTIONS] -e PATTERN [-e PATTERN...] [FILE...]
```

If no files are given, reads from stdin.

```sh
# Basic search
gogrep "error" app.log

# Case-insensitive, recursive, with line numbers
gogrep -rin "fixme" ./src/

# Fixed string with SIMD acceleration
gogrep -F "[ERROR]" app.log

# Multiple patterns (Aho-Corasick)
gogrep -F -e "timeout" -e "refused" -e "EOF" app.log

# PCRE2 regex with lookbehind
gogrep -P '(?<=error:\s)\w+' app.log

# Context lines
gogrep -C3 "panic" app.log

# Watch mode
gogrep --watch "ERROR" /var/log/syslog

# JSON output
gogrep --json "error" app.log
```
